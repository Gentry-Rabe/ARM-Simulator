This is a three-in-one program for ARM Assembly. 
The master program (team13_project3.go) runs a dissassembler, simulator, and pipeline simulator, which output to appropriately-named files.
Input is binary, although I would like to add an assembly reader in the future.

Current instruction input is limited to:
ADD, SUB, ADDI, SUBI, AND, ORR, EOR, B, CBZ, CBNZ, LSR, LSL, ASR, STUR, LDUR, BREAK, NOP,
with more to be added in the future

NOTE: This assignment was originally a group project. I and another student worked on the dissassembler and simulator program.
However, the pipeline simulator and restructuring into seperate programs has been entirely my work.
